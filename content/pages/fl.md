## Instances

### UFL instances

Can be found in the [UflLib][2]. Note that some of them have also been used for qUFL.

### qUFL instances

*   [ORLIB-format][3] (see [here][4] for a format description)
*   [LP-files of perspective reformulation-10 to 80 facilities][5]
*   [LP-files of perspective reformulation-100 to 250 facilities][6]

## Solutions

### UFL

Solutions are in the UflLlib format, i.e., for every customer, the facility it is allocated to is given, and in the end, the solution value is given.

* [Heuristic Results for KG-instances g*500/750 (Local Branching Table from the "Redesigning Benders"-paper)][8]
*Note*: Includes also local branching results for the 10 g*500/750 instances, where the optimal solution is known; moreover, for three instances, improved heuristic solutions compared to the ones in the paper are included (obtained a with more aggressive local branching setting).
